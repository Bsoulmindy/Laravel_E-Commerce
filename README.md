# About

<p>This repository will create a commercial web site, advanced than my previous repository "ProjetWeb2021" (which used only PHP & JS pure), this repository used Laravel 8 & Bootstrap 5!</p>
<p>I created this site because I wanted to learn more about modern frameworks, you can use this site on your own!</p>

# Configuration

<p>To use this repository to your own:</p>
<p>1- Install Laravel 8 & create a new project</p>
<p>2- Inside this new project, export all this repository to your project</p>
<p>3- You will need to configure .env (database infos & mail)</p>
<br>
<p>And I guess that's it, you have now the web site!</p>
