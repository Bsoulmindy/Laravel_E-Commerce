# About

This repository will create a commercial web site, advanced than my previous repository "ProjetWeb2021" (which used only PHP & JS pure), this repository used Laravel 8 & Bootstrap 5!
I created this site because I wanted to learn more about modern frameworks, you can use this site on your own!

# Configuration

To use this repository to your own:
1- Install Laravel 8 & create a new project
2- Inside this new project, export all this repository to your project
3- You will need to configure .env (database infos & mail)

And I guess that's it, you have now the web site!
